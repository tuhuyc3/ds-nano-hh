# Seattle AirBNB Seattle Analysis Project

### Installations:
The project has been done with the following packages were used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- datetime

### Motivation:
This is the submission for the 1st project of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Science Nanodegree. The project asked the course takers to select a dataset and answer 3-5 business questions.

My questions of interest are:
- How do average nightly prices vary by neighborhood? 
- What are the peak pricing months in Seattle? Do monthly average nightly price highly correlate with occupancy rate?
- How do high-rated listings compare in occupancy rate to lower-rated ones?

### Key Findings:
- Neighbourhoods with certain geographic traits command higher prices.
- Summer months are the most profitable for rentals.
- Reviews, while important, are just one of many factors influencing occupancy rates.
